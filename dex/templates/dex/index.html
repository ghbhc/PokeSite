        <p>Thanks for visiting my Pokedex website! This is a project I did for fun and professional development 
            using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target=_blank>Django</a>.  The original 151 Pokemon 
            are one of my favorite go-to data sets to work with because they have a lot of nostalgia value for 
            me and they present some fun ways to think about and organize data.</p>
            
        <p>To get the images and other information about the Pokemon for this webiste, I wrote a Python 
            <a href="https://github.com/ghbhc/PokeSite/blob/master/get-poke-data.py" target=_blank>script</a>
            to scrape data from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/" target=_blank>pokemon.com</a>.  If you're 
            interested in seeing any of templates, views, urls, etc... for this website, all of the source 
            code can be found on my Github page <a href="https://github.com/ghbhc/PokeSite" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>  
            
        <p>Please check out the different links in the top nav bar, or search for your favorite Gen 1 Pokemon 
            in the search bar.  You can browse to a particular Pokemon's detail page and click through all 151 of them.</p>
